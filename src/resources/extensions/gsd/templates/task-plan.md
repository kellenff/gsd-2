# Optional scope estimate — helps the plan quality validator detect over-scoped tasks.
# Tasks with 10+ estimated steps or 12+ estimated files trigger a warning to consider splitting.

## Observability Impact

<!-- OMIT THIS SECTION ENTIRELY for simple tasks that don't touch runtime boundaries,
     async flows, APIs, background processes, or error paths.
     Include it only when the task meaningfully changes how failures are detected or diagnosed. -->

- Signals added/changed: {{structured logs, statuses, errors, metrics}}
- How a future agent inspects this: {{command, endpoint, file, UI state}}
- Failure state exposed: {{what becomes visible on failure}}

## Inputs

<!-- Every input MUST be a backtick-wrapped file path. These paths are machine-parsed to
     derive task dependencies — vague descriptions without paths break dependency detection.
     For the first task in a slice with no prior task outputs, list the existing source files
     this task reads or modifies. -->

## Expected Output

<!-- Every output MUST be a backtick-wrapped file path — the specific files this task creates
     or modifies. These paths are machine-parsed to derive task dependencies.
     This task should produce a real increment toward making the slice goal/demo true. A full
     slice plan should not be able to mark every task complete while the claimed slice behavior
     still does not work at the stated proof level. -->
